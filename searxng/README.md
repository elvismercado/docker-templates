- if you dont have `settings.yml` and `uwsgi.ini` initially, remove `cap_drop: ALL` so files are generated then try to start again from a clean state
- before starting container first time
  - ensure `searxng` folder exists
  - place `limiter.toml` in `searxng` folder
  - place `settings.yml` in `searxng` folder
    - maybe start from a clean `settings.yml` file
  - make sure the directory and file are owned by your user
- start the container for the first time with `cap_drop: ALL` commented out
- stop the container and readd `cap_drop: ALL`
- start again
